filter:
Allowed functions: read, strlen, malloc, calloc, realloc, free, printf, perror
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a programm that will take one and only one argument s.

Your programm will then read from stdin and write all the content read in stdout
except that every occurence of s must be replaced by '*'.
(as many as the lenght of s)

For example :

./filter bonjour
will behave the same way as:
sed 's/bonjour/*******/g'

More generally, your program must be the equivalent of the shell script filter.sh present in this directory
( you can compare your program with it )

in case of error during read or a malloc you must write "Error: " followed by
the error message in stderr and return 1.

$> echo 'abcdefgaaaabcdefabc' | ./filter abc | cat -e
***defgaaa***def***

If the program is called whitout argument or with an empty argument or with
multiples arguments it must return 1.
